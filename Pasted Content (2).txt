2.	Student Section Mockup 
o	Sidebar: Menu with subcategories like "Scholarships," "National Service," "Internships."
o	Main Area: A dashboard with tools like a scholarship finder, upcoming deadlines, and a progress tracker for academic milestones.
3.	Career Section Mockup 
o	Top Bar: Filters for job types (e.g., government, private sector) and career stages (entry-level, mid-career).
o	Content: Job listings, a resume builder, and a "Skills Roadmap" showing required training or certifications.

Brand Guidelines (Suggested Starting Point)
Since this is a platform tied to the Emirati journey, it could reflect UAE identity while remaining modern and user-friendly. Here’s a conceptual guide:
•	Color Palette: 
o	Primary: Emirates-inspired colors like deep green (#007A3D), red (#CE1126), and white (#FFFFFF) from the UAE flag.
o	Accents: Gold (#FFD700) for elegance and black (#000000) for contrast.
o	Neutral: Soft beige (#F5F0E1) to evoke desert tones and modernity.
•	Typography: 
o	Primary Font: A clean sans-serif like "Dubai Font" (designed for UAE government use) or "Montserrat" for readability.
o	Secondary Font: A subtle Arabic script font like "Noto Naskh Arabic" for bilingual support.
o	Sizes: 16px base for body text, 24px for headings, 12px for footnotes.
•	Logo Concept: A minimalist icon combining a falcon (symbolizing UAE heritage) with a rising line (representing growth from student to retirement).
•	Tone & Voice: Warm, supportive, and empowering. Example: "From your first step to your golden years, we’re with you."

o	Career: Job board, professional development courses, networking hub.

4.	Accessibility

5.	Interactions 
o	Buttons: Rounded, 48px min. size for touch targets, with hover states (e.g., gold outline).
