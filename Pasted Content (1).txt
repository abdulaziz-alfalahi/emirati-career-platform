Below are regenerated conceptual image descriptions for all dashboards, incorporating arabesque patterns to reflect Emirati cultural heritage while aligning with your personas, structure, and services, as well as my earlier recommendations (brand guidelines: green #007A3D, red #CE1126, white #FFFFFF, gold #FFD700, beige #F5F0E1; fonts: Dubai Font/Montserrat; UI/UX: clean, user-focused). Arabesque patterns—geometric, floral, and interlacing designs—will be subtly integrated as background elements or accents to enhance the aesthetic without overwhelming functionality.
